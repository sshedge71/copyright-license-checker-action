# full-scan

A **whole-repository** copyright and license compliance scanner, packaged as a GitHub
composite Action. It complements the pull-request **patch scan** (at the repo root): where the
patch scan only inspects a PR's diff, `full-scan` walks **every source file** in a repository
so it also catches legacy files committed before the checker was enabled.

This directory is **self-contained** — it imports nothing from the patch scan.

## Run it

As a GitHub Action (composite; wired in behind the shared preflight orchestrator):

```yaml
- uses: qualcomm/copyright-license-checker-action/full-scan@<ref>
  with:
    repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}
    fail_on_findings: 'false'   # 'true' fails the build on blocking findings
```

Locally (from the repo root):

```bash
pip install -r full-scan/requirements.txt          # scancode must end up on PATH
python full-scan/full_scan.py <owner>/<repo> <fail_on_findings> --repo-path <checkout>
# e.g. python full-scan/full_scan.py qualcomm/some-repo false --repo-path .
```

`fail_on_findings` is optional (defaults to `true` on the CLI; the Action defaults it to
`false` / report-only). `--include-untracked` and `--include-licenseignore` widen the scan.
